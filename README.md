# Expenses-App

The Expenses App is a React-based application designed to help you track and manage your previously input expenses for each month of the year. It provides a user-friendly interface to add expenses, view them in a chart format, and list all expenses for the selected year.

## Concepts Implemented

This app incorporates various React concepts to create a functional and interactive user experience:

1. React Basics: The foundation of the app is built on React, allowing for the efficient creation of user interfaces using components and a virtual DOM.

2. Components: The app is structured into modular components, each responsible for a specific UI element or functionality. This modular approach enhances code organization and reusability.
